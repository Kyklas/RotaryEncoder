# RotaryEncoder
This is small and fast Arduino library for Rotary Encoder with interrupts

To make it wokr:
- add 100nF/0.1μF capacitors between A      pin & ground
- add 100nF/0.1μF capacitors between B      pin & ground
- add 100nF/0.1μF capacitors between button pin & ground

Supports:
- Arduino AVR
- Arduino ESP8266
- Arduino ESP32
- Arduino STM32
